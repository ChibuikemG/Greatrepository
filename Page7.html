    >Automation of technological and business-processe</h3>
<P>   The company was established in 2003 by Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, Jeffrey B. Straubel and Ian Wright. 
   In the first major sale of shares a successful businessman Elon Musk joined it as a Chairman of the Board in 
   February 2004.<p></p>
      Elon Musk wanted to demonstrate to the whole world that beautiful, dynamic electric vehicles with a large 
   range on one battery charge are not a fiction. <p></p>
      The presentation of high-class electric vehicle (fashionable, stylish and cutting edge kitsch) was necessary 
   for the rapid development from zero level and entry to the world consumer market. Therefore, the first model has 
   become a two-seater electric sports car Tesla Roadster, introduced in August 2006, which design was borrowed from 
   another, more famous model Lotus Elise. However, all the components were developed by the company staff with
   Elon Musk taking part in designing of each element. <p></p>
     To start up mass production of Tesla Roadster initially 
   scheduled for September 2007, Tesla Motors had been continuously looking for new investors, including Compass 
   Technology Partners, SDL Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, co-founders of Google  Sergey  Brin and  Larry Page, the 
   former president of eBay, Jeffrey Skoll and others. The amount of investment in Tesla Motors by 2007 has exceeded 
   $105 million, and by the time the first production version left the assembly line in 2008, has reached $140 million 
   (instead of the planned $ 25 million). In early August 2009, the company announced the overall profitability for the 
   month of July and making a profit of 1 million dollars, and 4 years later in May 2013 the company was the first and 
   the only one of the automobile companies to repay a loan of 465 million dollars, obtained from the US Department of 
   Energy [11, 12 ].</P>
