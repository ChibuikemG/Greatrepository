<P>   Vehicle emission, when getting onto the Earth surface in drainage basins, into open  water, underground water,
   leads to the contamination of water bodies. Dust and dirt carried by vehicles contains more than 200 types of 
   chemical of substances, many of which are radioactive. The dust deposits in  the lungs and dissolves in the 
   human blood, accumulates in the body,  causing diseases of various organs, cancer, allergies [4]. 
   The noise impact of vehicles is also unsafe for humans: a person loses a large amount of energy, it increases
   aggressiveness, develops hypertension, deteriorating hearing, reduces life expectancy [1].
   Due to  the growth of traffic flow,  the number  and power of electric equipment  in each separate  vehicle,   
   the level  of electromagnetic pollution increase [5].
   <p></p>
      The human central nervous system, immune system, eyes, gonads (endocrine glands of genital organs) are the most 
   sensitive to the electromagnetic emission. Herewith, power is less harmful than the duration of the radiation [6].
   But there is currently no alternative to automobile transport, that could be more convenient, affordable in 
   price-to-quality ratio and more popular in all spheres of activity. Moreover, it can [2]: - provide fast and timely 
   delivery of goods and passengers in small quantities; - deliver goods directly to the consumer; - is characterized 
   by enhanced maneuverability, mobility and convenience of driving. 
   <p></p>
      All of the aforesaid have led to the need to create and develop new types of car, which would primarily be more 
   environmentally friendly and less costly. Perhaps, it would be an electric car, a vehicle driven by an electric 
   motor instead of an internal combustion engine (ICE), which has no gearbox, due to  the attachment of a  shaft 
   directly to  wheels. It can be charged from both specialized charging stations, and from a home electric outlet.

      In 1998, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted the decision which indicated the number of cars with zero 
   exhaust, sold per  year. In the same 1998 year, this percentage was 2%, and by 2003 it has come to  over 10%.  
   The EU governments announced the transition to electric vehicles during the period of 2015 - 2020 and reinforced this
   decision, on the one hand, by imposing a substantial fines for excess of CO2 emissions by new vehicles, produced in the 
   EU in 2015, for the rate of 130 grams per kilometer, and by 2020 for the rate of 95g of CO2 per kilometer
   (up to 95 Euros for each  gram exceeding the norm), and, on the other hand, to get "super credits" on the production of 
   "clean" cars until 2016. </P>
