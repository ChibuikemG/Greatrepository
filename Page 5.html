<P>   According to conventional opinion, the advantage of an electric car, compared with conventional vehicle,  
   is its environmental friendliness, since it does not use combustible mixtures, and thus causes no harmful
   emissions into the atmosphere and the explosiveness considerably reduces. The energy used in electric vehicles
   today is definitely cheaper than gasoline and diesel fuel. The batteries of such vehicles can be charged during 
   the slope movement (recovery mode) or from sunlight. Easy assembly and simple design provide reliability and 
   service life of an electric vehicle, expand service interval mileage, resulting in significant cost savings for 
   the owner. Low noise level assures comfort [7]. 
   <P></P>
   But this car  is not  without  shortcomings  too, which  include 
   the production difficulties of cheap (precious metals are currently used to create them) and capacious battery 
   packs for a long-term work, free from harmful substances, which creates a problem of their disposal. 
   The problem is also the relatively low mileage between the battery chargings [2], which decreases if the ambient 
   temperature goes down. The temporary disadvantage is the absence of advanced electric transport infrastructure 
   (network of electric charging stations and service stations, etc.).</P>
