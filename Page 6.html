    >Automation of technological and business-processe</h3>

    <p>   The elimination of these shortcomings will lead to a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles 
       in the developed countries. In the XXI century, electric cars are confidently winning the automobile manufacturing 
       markets  of the USA, Europe and Asia. Tesla Motors is rightfully considered to be one of the leaders in production 
       of electric automobiles, as evidenced by the report data for the first half of 2015, published by the Internet 
       community of EV Sales. The company ranks second in the number of sold electric cars (21.6 thousand  hatchbacks of Model S), 
       being ahead of the world leader Nissan (25,000 Nissan Leaf) in sales in the USA - [8].

           Such rapid development of the company has been provided not only due to the name of the most mysterious, and 
        prominent inventor Nicola Tesla and huge financial investment, but also due to the competent innovation policy in 
        creating and promoting their electric vehicles in the global market with a long-term  strategic goal  to create 
        affordable costs of electric vehicles: <P></P>

                                              - explicit  target of operation sector to produce an electric vehicle, while the
                                              competitors were experimenting with hybrid cars, which became according to the
                                              company (as FEP technology almost completely depleted the possibilities of 
                                              modernization and improvement) a restraint in the development;<P></P>

                                              - in-house design and manufacturing of the main units (battery pack, its cooling 
                                              system, engine, electronics, charger,...), as well as their operational software; <P></P>

                                              - prompt infrastructure creation of charging and service stations its own electric
                                               vehicles;<P></P>

                                             - refusal from dealers services (sale of automobiles is carried out without engaging 
                                             any local dealers centers); <P></P>

                                             - implementation  of new  technologies, both in the production process (90% automation),
                                              and the vehicle driving process (management and control of all key functions via software);<P></P>
                                              
                                             - openness (Tesla Motors has opened its patent portfolio for public use to promote their 
                                             technologies and standards) [9, 10]. <P>
