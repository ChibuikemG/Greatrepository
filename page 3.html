    <p>   The essential component of ecological safety is the problem of environmental safety of vehicles, the urgency and
       importance of which is growing annually with the increasing number of vehicles. 
       In the 1980s the number of private vehicles has become extraordinarily high, which led to the formation of smoggy 
       bowls over the metropolis. All of the available environmental protection organizations started sounding an alarm 
       about the pollution, which had become global. US became a leader by pollution levels in some areas, namely,
       California in the early 1990s was one of the most polluted. Cars produce up to 70% of harmful emissions into the 
       atmosphere; the amount of emissions per year in the world is about 22 million tons of pollutants of different origin:
       oxide and carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, lead compounds, sulphur, particulate pollutants, aldehydes, 
       carcinogens. On average, they are increasing by 3.1% every year [1, 2, 3] <P></P>
       
          Absorbing oxygen, a vehicle emits intensively toxic components into the air, which leads to growth of annual environmental damage. Automobile transport, polluting the 
       biosphere with products of automobile fuel combustion, is a source of emissions into the environment a complex mixture
       of chemical compounds, the composition of which depends on the engine type, fuel type and vehicle operating conditions.
       Once in the atmosphere, as a result of chemical reactions with other air pollutants, they form even more hazardous 
       compounds affecting ruinously the ecosystem.</p>
